# Chamela ***Modeling Adaptation*** Workshop tutorial
#### Instructor: Josef C Uyeda (juyeda@vt.edu)

***

Welcome to the Chamela Modeling Adaptation Workshop! This workshop is intended to be completed in three 90-minute blocks. ***Before attending the workshop, please make sure you have the needed software and packages installed.***

**Required Packages**

  + phytools
  + treeplyr
  + OUwie
  + bayou (`remotes::install_github("uyedaj/bayou")`)
  + slouch
  + PCMFit

### This workshop will address the following goals:

Module 1. The theory behind the use of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models in phylogenetic comparative approaches. 
   
  + Gain an intuitive sense for how OU models work and how they relate to other models
  + Understand how the parameters of the model relate to biological processes, and how they are estimated
  + Be able to understand how parameters interact

Module 2. We will discuss implementations of OU models in phylogenetics packages and how they can be used to answer biological questions. 
   
  + OUwie - Testing for shifts in adaptive optima and niche breadth
  + slouch - Chasing peaks and phylogenetic inertia
  + bayou - Phylogenetic natural history and biologically-informative priors

Module 3. Using PCMBase & PCMFit to analyze complex evolutionary questions
    
  + Multivariate OU models - Everything, altogether, all at once
  + Using PCMFit - Constraints, constraints, constraints
